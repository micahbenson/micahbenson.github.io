I am a first-year PhD student at Boston University Computing & Data Sciences. **My research uses methods from mechanistic interpretability to analyze LLMs to better understand how they learn and represent social concepts, such as race and gender biases or political perspectives.** I am currently working with [Prof. Mark Crovella](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/crovella/) and [Prof. Ngozi Okidegbe](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/profile/okidegbe/) and am supported by a CDS Wexler Fellowship. 

Questions that interest me include: What are the best methods for finding complex social features in LLMs? Can we use feature steering to make models more fair? Can we use interpretability to develop better strategies for evaluating biases in LLMs than black-box testing? 

I am also broadly interested in the ethical impacts of AI systems, especially the deployment of LLMs across society. My work in this area includes evaluations of potential biases in LLM applications for policing. 

Before BU, I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a double major in data science and English. I did bioinformatics research on machine learning methods for predicting cervical cancer recurrence at the [Zhang Translational Genomics Laboratory](https://sites.wustl.edu/jinzhang/) where I was advised by Prof. Jin Zhang. 

In my free time, I coach high school cross country and track & field for Boston Public Schools and compete in local distance running races for [Battle Road Track Club](https://battleroadtc.org/). At WashU, I was a member of the varsity cross country and track teams.
