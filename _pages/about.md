I am a second-year PhD student at Boston University Computing & Data Sciences. **I research the ways AI systems harm people to inform both technical and policy solutions.** My research skills include LLM evaluations, ML interpretability, and qualitative methods. I pursue interdisciplinary projects and have collaborated closely with clinical psychologists and legal scholars. I work with [Prof. Aaron Muller](https://aaronmueller.github.io/) and am supported by a CDS Wexler Fellowship. 

My current research seeks to understand the psychological harms of conversational AI use. My team and I are evaluating how LLMs respond to users who disclose mental health symptoms, with the goal of characterizing patterns in these responses and proposing policy changes that would make the models safer for vulnerable users.

Additionally, I am pursuing research to interpret why LLMs sometimes give dangerous responses to users discussing mental health. Interpretability matters to responsible natural language processing because it gives us principled ways to understand and control the behavior of complex models. I aim to use my investigation of social concepts in LLMs to build techniques for steering language generation to be safer and fairer. 

Before BU, I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a double major in data science and English. I developed machine learning methods for predicting cervical cancer recurrence at the [Zhang Translational Genomics Laboratory](https://sites.wustl.edu/jinzhang/) where I was advised by Prof. Jin Zhang.

In my free time, I coach high school cross country and track & field for Boston Public Schools and compete in local distance running races for [Battle Road Track Club](https://battleroadtc.org/). In 2025, the girls and boys cross country teams I coach both won the MA XC State Championship! At WashU, I was a member of the varsity cross country and track teams.
