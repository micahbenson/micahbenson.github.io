I am a first-year PhD student at Boston University Computing & Data Sciences working on sociotechnical NLP reserach. **My research uses methods from mechanistic interpretability to analyze LLMs to better understand how they learn and represent social concepts, such as race and gender biases or political perspectives.** I am currently working with [Prof. Mark Crovella](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/crovella/) and [Prof. Ngozi Okidegbe](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/profile/okidegbe/) and am supported by a CDS Wexler Fellowship. 

Questions that interest me include: What is the best method for finding complex social features in LLMs? Can we use feature steering to make models more fair? Can we use interpretability to develop better methods for evaulating biases in LLMs than black-box testing? 

I am also broadly interested in the ethical impacts of AI systems on society, especially the deployment on LLMs into new domains. My work in this area includes evaluations of potential biases in LLM applications for policing. 

Prior to BU, I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a double major in data science and English. I did bioinformatics research on machine learning methods for predicting cervical cancer recurrance at the [Zhang Translational Genomics Laboratory](https://sites.wustl.edu/jinzhang/) where I was advised by Prof. Jin Zhang. 

In my free time, I am part of Boston's running community. I coach high school cross crountry and track & field for Boston Public Schools and compete in local races for [Battle Road Track Club](https://battleroadtc.org/). At WashU, I was a member of the varsity cross country and track teams.
